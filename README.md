#### Features:

Utilizes the Google Maps API to plot event locations on the "Interests" page
Utilizes the Github API to allow a user to pull github repo information
Still to add - EmailJS to enable the contact form to send emails
Notes:
All CSS and HTML code has been validated by the W3C validators
Errors in CSS regarding unknown vendor extensions are unavoidable and insignificant. These are due to the fact that vendor extensions are proprietary and thus will always be invalid in standard CSS
Errors in HTML regarding dates attributes on <div> tags are unavoidable and insignificant. These are due to the fact that dates is a custom attribute used to style our CSS timeline
